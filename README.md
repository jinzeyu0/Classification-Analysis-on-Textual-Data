Course Project in Data mining
Instructions for how to run code in Project:

Each part is labeled in the Python code, please follow the below steps to run each part smoothly. 
Some of the steps are order dependent, which means you have to run the previous part first.

To Run part A, simply select and run every thing in part A.
A Histogram will pop up when done.

To Run part B, select and run everything in part B. After completion, please select and run "X_train_counts.shape" and "X_test_counts.shape" to see the results. 

To Run part C, select and run everything in part C. The program should automatically print out the top 10 most significant terms in each class. 

To Run part D, select and run everything in part D. It will generate four matrices, two for LSI training and testing, and two for NMF training and testing.

To Run part E, first run the code blocks divided by the "===" lines to load the data and do target mapping. Then, select and run the whole part B for data preprocessing. After that, run part D for dimension reduction. Finally, run the rest of part E code to see the plots and calculations. However, since there are different test cases, please use "W_train" and "W_test" for NMF, and "Dk_train_transpose" and "Dk_test_transpose" for SLI. The hard and soft margin is implemented, and therefore no need to change that parameter.

To Run part F, simply select and run everything in part F. However, since there are different test cases, please use "W_train" and "W_test" for NMF, and "Dk_train_transpose" and "Dk_test_transpose" for SLI. 

To Run part G, simply select and run everything in part G.

To Run part I, simply select and run everything in part I.However, since there are different test cases, please use "W_train" and "W_test" for NMF, and "Dk_train_transpose" and "Dk_test_transpose" for SLI. 

To Run part I+, simply select and run everything in part I+.However, since there are different test cases, please use "W_train" and "W_test" for NMF, and "Dk_train_transpose" and "Dk_test_transpose" for SLI.
